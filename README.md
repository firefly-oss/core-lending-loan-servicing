## Overview

The **Core Lending Loan Servicing Microservice** is a critical component of the **Firefly OpenCore Banking Platform**, developed by **Firefly Software Solutions Inc** under the Apache 2.0 license. This microservice is responsible for comprehensive loan servicing operations after loan origination and disbursement.

This service provides a complete loan lifecycle management system, handling everything from disbursements and repayment schedules to interest accruals, rate changes, and servicing events. It's designed with reactive programming principles using Spring WebFlux and R2DBC for high-performance, non-blocking operations.

**Organization**: [firefly-oss](https://github.com/firefly-oss)
**Website**: [getfirefly.io](https://getfirefly.io)
**License**: Apache 2.0

## Architecture

The microservice follows a clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns across multiple Maven modules:

### Module Structure

- **`core-lending-loan-servicing-interfaces`**: Contains DTOs, interfaces, enums, and API contracts
- **`core-lending-loan-servicing-models`**: Contains JPA entities, repositories, and database migrations
- **`core-lending-loan-servicing-core`**: Contains business logic, service implementations, and mappers
- **`core-lending-loan-servicing-web`**: Contains REST controllers, web configuration, and application entry point
- **`core-lending-loan-servicing-sdk`**: Contains generated client SDK for external integrations

### Core Capabilities

- **Loan Servicing Case Management**: Central management of loan servicing lifecycle with comprehensive configuration
- **Disbursement Planning & Tracking**: Staged disbursement schedules for construction loans and line of credit draws
- **Installment Management**: Planned installments and actual payment records with internal/external payment tracking
- **Balance Tracking**: Historical balance snapshots with principal, interest, and fees outstanding
- **Interest & Fee Accruals**: Automated calculation and tracking of interest, penalties, and fees
- **Rate Change Management**: Interest rate adjustments with full audit trail
- **Loan Restructuring**: Complete restructuring history with old/new terms comparison
- **Escrow Management**: Comprehensive escrow accounts for all lending products (insurance, taxes, reserves, fees, trade finance, construction)
- **Rebate Processing**: Borrower rebates, distributor commissions, and promotional incentives
- **Notification System**: Multi-channel notifications to loan parties (email, SMS, push, in-app, mail, phone)
- **Servicing Events**: Comprehensive event tracking for restructures, extensions, and collections

## Technology Stack

- **Java 25**: Latest LTS version with virtual threads support
- **Spring Boot 3.x**: Modern Spring framework with native compilation support
- **Spring WebFlux**: Reactive web framework for non-blocking I/O
- **R2DBC**: Reactive database connectivity for PostgreSQL
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with advanced features
- **Flyway**: Database migration and versioning
- **Maven**: Build automation and dependency management
- **OpenAPI 3**: API documentation and client generation
- **MapStruct**: Type-safe bean mapping
- **Lombok**: Boilerplate code reduction
- **Docker**: Containerization and deployment

## Data Model

The microservice manages a comprehensive loan servicing data model with the following core entities:

### Decoupled Architecture

The microservice is **completely decoupled from the internal account system**, enabling lending products for any customer:

#### **Key Design Principles**

1. **No Account Dependency**
   - `LoanServicingCase` references `applicationId` (from loan origination), NOT `accountId`
   - Customers do NOT need an internal account to receive a loan
   - Payment collection is configured per installment, not per customer

2. **Flexible Payment Collection**
   - Each `LoanInstallmentPlan` specifies its own payment method (INTERNAL or EXTERNAL)
   - Supports mixed payment methods within the same loan (e.g., first payment internal, rest external)

#### **Payment Methods**

1. **INTERNAL Payments** (Customer has internal account)
   - Payment is debited from customer's internal account
   - `LoanInstallmentPlan.paymentAccountId` references the customer's internal account
   - `LoanInstallmentRecordInternalTransaction` tracks the account-to-account movement
   - Both `sourceAccountId` (customer) and `destinationAccountId` (loan) are internal

2. **EXTERNAL Payments** (Customer has NO internal account)
   - Payment is collected via external Payment Service Provider (PSP)
   - `LoanInstallmentPlan.paymentProviderId` references the PSP (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
   - `LoanInstallmentPlan.externalAccountReference` stores customer's external account identifier
   - `LoanInstallmentRecordExternalTransaction` tracks PSP transaction details
   - Supports direct debit from external bank accounts, credit cards, etc.

#### **Use Cases**

- **Internal Customer**: Customer has a checking account with the bank → Use INTERNAL payment method
- **External Customer**: Customer banks elsewhere → Use EXTERNAL payment method with PSP
- **Mixed Portfolio**: Some customers internal, some external → Each installment plan configured independently
- **Loan Tracking**: All loans trace back to their originating `applicationId` for complete audit trail

This architecture ensures the loan servicing system can provide lending products to **any customer**, regardless of whether they have an internal account relationship.
